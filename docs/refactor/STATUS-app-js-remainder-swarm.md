# STATUS — app.js Remainder Teardown Swarm

> Orchestrator ledger. **Last updated:** 2026-05-31 (session 14 — next discovery lanes assigned).
> Branch: `refactor/app-js-decompose` · Integration checkout: `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored`
> Orchestrator surface: **Cursor Agent (Composer 2.5 Fast)** + **Task subagents** + **git worktrees** (no cmux)

## Startup checklist (session 2)

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Branch | `refactor/app-js-decompose` ✓ |
| Pre-existing dirty files | `M app.js` (1-line discovery webhook candidate — **do not mix into module cuts**), `M package-lock.json`, untracked `docs/refactor/*` |
| Node / npm | v24.13.0 / 11.13.0 ✓ |
| Baseline `npm test` | **892 pass / 0 fail / 0 skip** (188 suites, ~7.6s) |
| `app.js` LOC (current) | **9,143** (post discovery status handoff; was 12,456 post Phase 5 cut #1) |
| `SetActiveBranch` | `refactor/app-js-decompose` ✓ |
| Swarm model | Cursor Task subagents per [PROMPT-app-js-remainder-cursor-swarm-orchestrator.md](./PROMPT-app-js-remainder-cursor-swarm-orchestrator.md) |

## Swarm runtime (Cursor)

| Role | subagent_type | model | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator / integrator | parent Agent | Composer 2.5 Fast | **active** |
| Research | `explore` | composer-2.5-fast | Phase 0 spawned |
| Frontend implementation | `frontend-developer` | claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high | Cut 3 **done** |
| Backend / transport | `backend-developer` | gpt-5.5-extra-high | Phase 1 **done** |
| QA pre-merge | `code-reviewer` | claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high | idle |
| Worktree ops | `shell` | composer-2.5-fast | idle |
| Debug / repair | `debugger` | claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high | idle |

## Parallel refactor coordination (session 7)

Integration checkout is orchestrator-only. Dirty mixed work found on
`refactor/app-js-decompose` was preserved as
`stash@{0}: orchestrator mixed integration WIP before owner branch split`, then
replayed onto owner branches.

| Order | Track | Branch | Worktree | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | B — index.html decompose | `refactor/index-html-decompose` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/index-html-decompose` | **MERGED** `a432bd2` | `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail** after `npm install --prefix server` |

| 3 | A — app.js follow-up | `refactor/app-js-decompose-app-config-core-followup` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-app-config-core-followup` | **MERGED** `d2d5224` | Branch gate after rebase `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; post-merge integration `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; `git diff --check` clean; exact conflict-marker scan clean |
| 4 | A — apps-script relay helpers | `refactor/app-js-decompose-apps-script-relay-helpers` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-apps-script-relay-helpers` | **MERGED** `a2a970d` | Branch gate after rebase `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; post-merge integration `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; `app.js` = **10,194 LOC** |

| 7 | A — discovery status handoff | `refactor/app-js-decompose-discovery-status-handoff` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-discovery-status-handoff` | **MERGED** `942248c` | Branch gate after rebase `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; post-merge integration `npm test` = **894 pass / 0 fail**; `node --check` clean; `git diff --check` clean; exact conflict-marker scan clean; `app.js` = **9,143 LOC** |
| 8 | A — Apps Script deploy UI | `refactor/app-js-decompose-apps-script-deploy` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-apps-script-deploy` | **IN FLIGHT** | Merge first among session 14 lanes; owns `apps-script-deploy.js`, thin `app.js` wrappers/bridge, one `index.html` script tag |
| 9 | A — discovery drawer | `refactor/app-js-decompose-discovery-drawer` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-discovery-drawer` | **IN FLIGHT** | Merge after Apps Script deploy UI; owns `discovery-drawer.js`, thin `app.js` wrappers/bridge, one `index.html` script tag |
| 10 | A — ingest URL flow | `refactor/app-js-decompose-ingest-url-flow` | `/Users/emilionunezgarcia/Job-Bored-worktrees/appjs-ingest-url-flow` | **IN FLIGHT** | Merge after discovery drawer; owns `ingest-url-flow.js`, thin `app.js` wrappers/bridge, one `index.html` script tag |

Shared-file rule in force: `index.html` structural changes landed with B first,
legacy CSS `<head>` links landed with C, and the scoped A config follow-up landed
after rebasing onto post-C integration. The first Phase 7 app-js lane
(`apps-script-relay-helpers.js`) landed next from a rebased worker branch, then
`scraper-ats-config.js` landed from a rebased worker branch, then
`discovery-engine-state.js` landed from a rebased worker branch, then
`discovery-status-handoff.js` landed from a rebased worker branch. Session 14
created three fresh app-js lanes from integration tip `0250251`; merge order is
**apps-script-deploy → discovery-drawer → ingest-url-flow**.

Follow-up Cursor prompts are staged in
[FOLLOWUP-CURSOR-SWARM-2026-05-31.md](./FOLLOWUP-CURSOR-SWARM-2026-05-31.md).
Use those prompts instead of a broad "keep refactoring until <1000 LOC" request.

## Research manifests (Phase 0)

| Module | Agent | Manifest | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `keyword-profile-match.js` | explore | [manifest complete — see agent session 2026-05-31] | **done** |
| `profile-materials.js` | explore | [manifest complete — see agent session 2026-05-31] | **done** |
| `expired-review-ui.js` | explore | [manifest complete — see agent session 2026-05-31] | **done** |
| Phase 1 bridge (`JobBoredApp.core.host`) | explore | [manifest complete — see agent session 2026-05-31] | **done** |
| `posting-enrichment.js` | explore | [manifest complete — see agent session 2026-05-31] | **done** |

## Phase timeline

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Baseline + research manifests (cuts 3–6 + bridge) | **DONE** |
| 1 | Foundation bridge (`JobBoredApp.core.host` + accessors) | **DONE** (892 pass; uncommitted) |
| 2 | Leaf modules: keyword → profile → expired UI → enrichment | **DONE** |
| 3 | Materials / ATS / onboarding / settings / logo / feature init | **DONE** |
| 4 | Pipeline / Sheets | **DONE** (`95657ad`, `c4d529b`, `576782d`; **892 pass**) |
| 5 | Discovery remainder | **in progress** (run tracker + relay helpers + scraper ATS config + engine state + status handoff done) |
| 5b | Index decomposition guardrail | **DONE** (`a432bd2`; **894 pass**) |
| 6 | Auth / config / core collapse | in progress; config-core follow-up merged |

## Blockers / hygiene

1. **Discovery autofill WIP** — stashed as `discovery autofill WIP (post-phase4)` (`fb7c653`); breaks 4 discovery tests until finished; keep out of module-cut commits.
2. Phase 2 leaf cuts committed: `5cd73d6`, `51f97e4`, `cf1c654`.
3. **Plan LOC table** — re-derive ranges from **9,143** LOC `app.js` before each cut.
4. **Mixed integration WIP backup** — `stash@{0}` is retained only as a recovery snapshot after replaying files to owner branches.

## Next actions (orchestrator)

1. ~~Collect Phase 0 research manifests~~ **done** (all 5 ready)
1. ~~Land Phase 1 foundation bridge~~ **done** (892 pass; commit when authorized).
2. ~~Phase 3 + parallel batch~~ **done** (`11b6d86`, `c5748db`, `6facfc2` integrated; **892 pass**).
3. ~~Phase 4~~ **done** — writeback, read-load, pipeline-render integrated; **892 pass** at **13,140** LOC.
4. Phase 5 cut #1 **done** — `discovery-run-tracker.js`; **892 pass** at **12,456** LOC.
5. Track B index decomposition **merged** — `a432bd2`; **894 pass**.
6. Track C CSS split **merged** — `37241c6`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
7. Track A config follow-up **merged** — `d2d5224`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
8. Apps Script relay helpers **merged** — `a2a970d`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
9. Scraper ATS config **merged** — `2a3fcb5`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
10. Discovery engine state **merged** — `7f9a2ee`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
11. Discovery status handoff **merged** — `942248c`; branch and integration **894 pass**.
12. Session 14 lanes created at integration tip `0250251`: `apps-script-deploy`, `discovery-drawer`, and `ingest-url-flow`.
13. Merge order for session 14: **apps-script-deploy → discovery-drawer → ingest-url-flow**. Each branch must pass `git diff --check refactor/app-js-decompose...HEAD`, exact conflict-marker scan, `node --check` for touched JS, and full `npm test` before merge.
14. After each merge, update this status doc with the branch gate, post-merge gate, commit SHA, and new `app.js` LOC.

## `index.html` script order (post Phase 5 cut #1)

```
… → sheets-writeback → sheets-read-load → pipeline-render → discovery-run-tracker → sheet-access-setup → apps-script-relay-helpers → scraper-ats-config → discovery-engine-state → discovery-status-handoff → [apps-script-deploy] → [discovery-drawer] → [ingest-url-flow] → app.js?v=30
```

## Owner-only risks (unchanged)

- Leaked Gemini key/history cleanup remains outside this refactor; needs owner approval before public release.
